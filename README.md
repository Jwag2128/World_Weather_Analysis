# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this project was to retrieve and map the weather in 2000 random cities.
The next part was to take these random cities and generate possible hotels to stay nearby based on the individual weather parameters chosen.
Lastly, we mapped out a travel itenary to 4 randonmly chosen cities.
